The KSRTC Online Concession System is a web-based application designed to digitize and 
streamline the student concession application process for Kerala State Road Transport 
Corporation (KSRTC). Traditionally, students had to manually apply for travel concessions 
through their respective colleges, get approval, and then visit the KSRTC depot for final 
verification and issuance of the concession pass. This project eliminates the inefficiencies of 
the manual system by providing an automated, transparent, and user-friendly platform for 
students, colleges, and KSRTC depots.
The system allows students to create an account and submit their concession application online. 
They are required to enter essential details such as name, college ID, date of birth, gender, 
address, phone number, alternate phone number, email, course, department, semester, 
start and end travel points, username, and password. Once submitted, the application is 
sent to the respective college office for verification. College authorities have a dedicated login 
where they can review student details and verify whether the applicant is currently enrolled in 
the institution. If the verification is successful, the application is forwarded to the KSRTC 
depot for further processing.
The KSRTC depot officers also have their own login portal where they can access applications 
that have been approved by colleges. They can either approve or reject the applications based 
on eligibility criteria. If the application is approved, the student is notified and required to make 
the necessary payment for the concession pass. The payment is made outside the application
(via bank transfer, UPI, or other methods), and students must log in to their dashboard to submit 
transaction details such as transaction ID, transaction date, name of the account holder, 
and the amount paid. The depot officers then verify the transaction details before processing 
and dispatching the concession pass.
Once the transaction is verified, the KSRTC depot issues the concession pass, which is sent 
to the student via postal service within 3-4 days. Students can track their application status 
in real-time, from submission to approval and dispatch. Additionally, the system includes a 
concession renewal feature, allowing students to renew their concession pass without having 
to re-enter all their details. Colleges and students can also view the status of applications, 
ensuring complete transparency in the process.
The project is built using React.js for the frontend, ensuring a responsive and interactive user 
interface. The backend is developed using Node.js and Express.js, handling API requests and 
application logic. The system utilizes MongoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval, while 
JWT (JSON Web Token) is used for secure authentication. The interface is styled using 
CSS/Tailwind, providing a modern and user-friendly experience.
The KSRTC Online Concession System significantly improves the efficiency of the concession 
approval process by reducing paperwork, eliminating delays, and providing real-time status 
tracking. By introducing automated verification, secure transactions, and digital recordkeeping, the system ensures a faster, more reliable, and student-friendly approach to obtaining 
KSRTC travel concessions. This digital transformation makes the concession process more 
accessible and efficient for students, colleges, and KSRTC depots alike.
